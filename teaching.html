<font class="title">10.022 Modelling Uncertainty - Engineering Systems and Design (ESD)</font></a><br>
Fall 2021<br>
<p align=justify>Probability and statistics are two powerful and complementary ways to explain, forecast, and visualise uncertainty. Probability uses knowledge of a system’s behaviour to predict its future outcomes, while statistics analyses data from past outcomes to model a system’s behaviour.  In this course, we will introduce the fundamentals of probability and statistics and apply them in real life problems.

<font class="title">40.319 Statistical Machine Learning - Engineering Systems and Design (ESD)</font></a><br>
Spring 2021<br>
<p align=justify>An agent is intelligent if it perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of successfully achieving its goals. In this course, we will study how to imbue machines with intelligence, focusing on foundational principles and mathematical theories of real-world modelling, problem solving and statistical learning.

<font class="title">Capstone Project (SUTD)</font></a><br>
Spring/Summer 2017 – 2020, Summer 2021<br>
<p align=justify>The Capstone project brings together students from different Majors to work in design teams, contributing their respective expertise and skills to solve real-world challenges. It also provides them with a realistic design situation where projects usually span multiple disciplines and require team-based efforts to create a solution.

<font class="title">40.651 Algorithmic Game Theory - Engineering Systems and Design (ESD) - Graduate</font></a><br>
Fall 2016, Spring 2019<br>
<p align=justify>This is a graduate level course in Algorithmic Game Theory which aims at providing the fundamental concepts of non-cooperative game theory, at exploring its connections to computational issues, and at showing a broad spectrum of applications in different fields. The topics to be covered in this course include strategic-form games, Nash equilibria (and variants), price of anarchy, auctions, and learning.

Summer 2016, Summer 2020<br>
<p align=justify>The course will provide a consistent framework for game-theoretic concepts, some of which have already been informally presented to the students in other courses. The course will cover the basic concepts in game theory, allowing the students to use strategic models in their capstone research.

<font class="title">CS 8803: Advanced Topics in Algorithmic Game
Theory</font><!--</a>--><br>
Spring 2013<br>
Co-taught with Jugal Garg and Ruta Mehta
<p align=justify>A research oriented course focusing on the intersection of
computer science and game theory. During the first half of the course, the
participants will be exposed to key ideas and results from algorithmic game
theory. In the second part we will be exploring research tangents, looking
into open questions and working on formulating novel problems.

<font class="title">Discrete Fourier Analysis and Applications</font><br>
Spring 2012<br>
 Co-taught with Elena Grigorescu, Will Perkins and Lev Reyzin
<p align=justify>
Discrete fourier analysis provides a set of techniques that have found wide applicability in mathematics and computer science. The underlying insight is that the projection of functions onto the Fourier basis can often provide the right angle in analyzing properties of various mathematical objects, such as boolean functions, graphs, PRGs, and sets of integers.
